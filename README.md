A fully functional e commerce site created using MERN stack

Deployed site:

https://nagok-e-commerce.netlify.app/

Key features:

1. All app state is managed by Redux and local state is reserved for some UI state and form data.
2. UI is created on top of Material UI.
3. All components are functional and the whole components lifecycle is managed by using newish Hook API.
4. I use JSS instead of CSS to follow material UI convention.
